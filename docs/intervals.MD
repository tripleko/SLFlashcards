OK, first off a disclaimer. I'm not sure anybody in the world knows what the optimal intervals are for spaced reptition, if such a thing exists. My guess is that in actuality it will vary from person to person and the type of content being studied.

If you disagree with my default intervals and want to use your own, I encourage you to edit the values.

The default intervals I've chosen are loosely based off of my own personal experiences and research on the topic I've read. I believe, unlike some others, that there should ideally be multiple reviews on the first day, each with at least a gap of 10 minutes. This differs from the default intervals I've seen in most other spaced reptition software. I've found that waiting a full day to review doesn't work out well for me and there is some research to suggest that (at least in mice) waiting more than a few hours for the first review is less than ideal.

So my first intervals are... 20 seconds (only if the wrong answer is given), 10 minutes, 10 minutes, and 12 hours. My understanding of the research in mice from the 2005 paper "Making Memories Stick" published in Scientific American is that there need to be 3 exposures with at least 10 minute gap between each for a memory to stick around longer term. I found that when I only got an answer right one time, if I waited until the next day to re-test, my recall % was somehwat low if I had been studying a large amount of material.

The reason that I chose 12 hours instead of 24 hours was that I don't think there's anything magical about waiting a full 24 hours and I wanted to give myself the option to study something at night, go to bed, and study it again in the morning. For this reason, I simply found it more practical to space all of my intervals this way. For example, instead of having an interval be 4 days, I would make it be 3 days and 12 hours. This was just a personal adjustment to account for that fact that I did not consistently study at the same hour each day. It's important to remember that the intervals are the *minimum* amount of time that will lapse before I study a card and in practice the actual amount of time that lapses will be greater by some amount.

For the longer intervals, I found that while there is some guidance in academic literature (mostly that they should gradually increase), there's not a lot of data on the optimal gap intervals for people who want to recall a flashcard over a very long period of time. Just a lot of folks who extrapolate data out and assume massive space increases should work in the much longer term too. My personal guess is that you can't increase the intervals excessively and expect to recall knowledge for a lifetime so I capped off the maximum interval at around two months.

Also, unlike other programs, I decided that I wouldn't have huge exponential increases in the the gap for the longer intervals and instead gradually increase the time by no more than 2 days at a time. While I figure this isn't optimal if my goal is to absolutely mimimize my study time, for practical purposes, I figured it's fairly small extra time investment to make sure I'm not forgetting cards in the shorter term.

If I get a card wrong at any point, the card's interval is reset back to 0.

0 - 20 seconds (only used if the studiee responds wrong)
1 - 10 minutes
2 - 10 minutes

4 - 1 day 12 hours
5 - 2 days 12 hours
6 - 4 days 12 hours
7 - 6 days 12 hours
8 - 8 days 12 hours
9 - 10 days 12 hours
10 - 12 days 12 hours
11 - 14 days 12 hours
12 - 16 days 12 hours
13 - 18 days 12 hours
14 - 20 days 12 hours
15 - 22 days 12 hours
16 - 24 days 12 hours
17 - 26 days 12 hours
18 - 28 days 12 hours
19 - 30 days 12 hours
20 - 32 days 12 hours
21 - 34 days 12 hours
22 - 36 days 12 hours
23 - 38 days 12 hours
24 - 40 days 12 hours
25 - 42 days 12 hours
26 - 44 days 12 hours
27 - 46 days 12 hours
28 - 48 days 12 hours
29 - 50 days 12 hours
30 - 52 days 12 hours
31 - 54 days 12 hours
32 - 56 days 12 hours
33 - 58 days 12 hours
34 - 60 days 12 hours
35 - 62 days 12 hours

About card priority... the reality is that I won't always be able to study every card that is due. For this reason, the priority on which cards appear before me should go to cards in the following intervals:

1 to 3 > 0 (new cards or wrongly answered) > 4 > 5 > 6 > ... > 35

So cards that require more immediate review come first, followed by new cards, followed by cards that require slightly less immediate review in rough order of age.
