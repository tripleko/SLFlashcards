TODO: Will add details here later.

This is how card_type works:

Default:
0

Drawing area only:
1

Sound (back) only:
20

Sound(front) only:
300

Sound (front) and drawing area:
301

Use modulo (and optionally integer division) to get the digit values. Can add more card types following a similar pattern.
