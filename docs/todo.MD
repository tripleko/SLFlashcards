Current priorities:

* Need to add unit testing before my codebase gets any bigger.
* Current UI is a bit incomplete and it's very hacky to add or remove decks.
* Flashcard viewing options don't have any advanced filters either and anybody that doesn't know how to get around in SQLite is currently screwed. I would like to make the application generally more accessible.
* Documentation is woefully incomplete.
